# Heart Attack Analysis

This project analyzes a heart attack dataset to identify key risk factors and build a predictive model for heart attack risk. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation using a Random Forest classifier. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to heart attacks and to develop a tool for early risk assessment.
